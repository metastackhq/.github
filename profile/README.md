# Metastack

### Metastack is bringing 3 game-changing products inside one single platform:

- Revolutionary knowledge management tool
- Extensive library of tactical content
- Standardized operational framework for competitive players

Made specifically for Counter-Strike professionals and competitive players.
It allows you to easily create, organize, and update your in-game strategies,
screenshots & videos, and other tactical content.

Metastack will also have an extensive and curated content library from where
you can discover and import tactical content into your personal or team workspace.
We made every content piece into an object that can be edited and personalized
to your needs and linked & reused inside other content pieces.

The entire platform is establishing a much-needed standardization and
bringing the system of operation from the best teams in the world to all players.
